This is a preliminar simulation written in Verilog for the Konami k051962 Tile Layer Generator
used in many Konami arcade game machines at the end of 80's and beginning of 90's. This is used together
with his twin k052109 IC. This code is based on the schematics released by @Furrtek which was able to
trace the internal channeled gate array structure of this IC and identify the functions that were used.
